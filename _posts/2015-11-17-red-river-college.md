Brian Rountree, MLIS, Instructor at Red River College spoke of his plans for Klassmates:

> I have found it very helpful to have the students practice using as many different library programs as I can find. It brings ‘real life’ to the classroom activities and assignments. It provides skills they can use when at their practicum sites. It is a bonus when they can say at an interview that they are familiar with certain products. Koha is used by several libraries in the Winnipeg, Manitoba area so we are excited to be able to practice with this program. The program will be used in two cataloguing courses [Introduction and Multi-media Resources], in an Introduction to Libraries course, and in a Collection Development course.
