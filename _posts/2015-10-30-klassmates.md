Nicole Engard, Vice President of Community Outreach for ByWater commented on the Klassmates program:

> When I was in library school, I remember learning about library systems from books and cataloging in word processing applications. I didn’t get a chance to learn about using an ILS until I was in the library. With this program future librarians will already have hands on experience with one of the best integrated library systems out there!
