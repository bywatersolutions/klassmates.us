We hope all of you are enjoying your Klassmates System. Remember to visit the ByWater Solutions website for all new tutorials on Koha for you and your students. We have all tutorial videos on our youtube channel as well.

We wanted to let you know about an update to your site. All of you may notice that web browsers are becoming much more "vocal" about warning users when they connect to unsecured websites, that is, sites not protected with a SSL certificate.

In next week or so, we will be implementing SSL on all sites hosted on the Klassmates system. We will be enabling automatic redirection from http to https. You will not need to do anything on your side, we just want you to be aware this is coming!

Thank you for sharing the enthusiasm for Koha with your class!
