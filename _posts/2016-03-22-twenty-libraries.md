William Helling, Instructor at IUPUI, spoke of his class’s experience with Klassmates so far:

> My LIS graduate course, Library Systems, is going very well, and the Koha library we created is the cornerstone of the class that we build upon every week. Our library is not without blemishes, of course (as in real life!), but it was constructed from the ground up, from nothing.

Brian Rountree, MLIS, Instructor at Red River College spoke of his plans for Klassmates:

> I have found it very helpful to have the students practice using as many different library programs as I can find. It brings ‘real life’ to the classroom activities and assignments. It provides skills they can use when at their practicum sites. It is a bonus when they can say at an interview that they are familiar with certain products.

Nicole C. Engard, Vice President of Community Outreach, commented on the quick success of Klassmates:

> I’m so excited to see so many instructors using Koha in their classes. When I was in library school I didn’t have this opportunity and strongly believe that using a full ILS in a classroom setting makes a huge difference when students enter the work force.
